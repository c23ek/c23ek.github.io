        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 1: Coding remains an entirely foreign concept to me. As I'm sure anyone can tell by the aesthetics of my websites, the only thing that I can really do so far is make squares and rectagles with links. I guess it's a start! I hope to continue to learn more skills as I progress. </div>

        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 2: In terms of coding, this week was a relatively quiet one. However, our class visit to House 14 was both fun and inspiring as it relates to our ocean coding projects. While before I was planning on creating something to do with pollution in the ocean, my buddies' interest in dolphins and sharks makes it likely that I will do something related to those animals. Additionally, with the bit of coding that I did do, I struggled to recreate the ease in which i attached photos to websites but eventually figured out a makeshift way to do this by copying the image address.</div>
