        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 1: Coding remains an entirely foreign concept to me. As I'm sure anyone can tell by the aesthetics of my websites, the only thing that I can really do so far is make squares and rectagles with links. I guess it's a start! I hope to continue to learn more skills as I progress. </div>

        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 2: In terms of coding, this week was a relatively quiet one. However, our class visit to House 14 was both fun and inspiring as it relates to our ocean coding projects. While before I was planning on creating something to do with pollution in the ocean, my buddies' interest in dolphins and sharks makes it likely that I will do something related to those animals. Additionally, with the bit of coding that I did do, I struggled to recreate the ease in which i attached photos to websites but eventually figured out a makeshift way to do this by copying the image address.</div>

        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 3: This week, I started to work on my ocean project. In order to create the game, I started in scratch because my HTML knowledge is not yet at a high enough level to code something this complex. What I have so far is a trash can, a recycling bin, and an object that you can place in either of them. What I now need to do is figure out the logistics of the game: What objects will be on display and what the correct answers will be. I also need to convert the scracth code into HTML.</div>

        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 4: I learned a little bit about javascript this week. It is a universal language that you can use by hitting inspect on any browser. I am still unfamiliar with the syntax of javascript but will improve as time goes on. It is fun to experiment with. </div>

        <div id="entry" class="square"> Entry 5: I have changed my project entirely! I am stsrting to work on connecting a javascript page to an html page through a button that submits and input. This will hopefully allow me to transfer audio data from a microphone to an html page that I can hear.</div>
