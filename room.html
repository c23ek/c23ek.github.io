        <div> Stress balls, squishy toys, and other assorted fun will be of use to students who wish to ease the stress that comes with daily high school life. It will also aid the focus of students working on computer science projects.</div>

        <div> Not only will a refrigerator allow for any type of food to be stored by the school in this room, it will also make it possible for students to bring their own snacks that need to remain cold.(I think this also serves as a dry erase board which is just too awesome and it helps with brainstoriming) And it's pretty cheap!</div>
