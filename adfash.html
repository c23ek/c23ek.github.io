        <div>My adversarial fashion design consists of two components. One is a pair of sunglasses that's top arches back and touches your eyes to block an overhead camera from detecting your eyes from both sides. The second is a long visor that projects the image of a different face onto your face in order to confuse the facial recognition technology.</div>
